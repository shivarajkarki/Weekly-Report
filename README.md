Description of work done so far

Hi,

This repository contains
- Description of work that is done weeky
- Codes that are coded till now
- and Miscellaneous

>This repository contains exercises that I have tried till now, and below is the sequence of my learning.

Started with deep learning and neural networks by Andrew ng

Solved exercises gievn in the course

* Update Building your Deep Neural Network - Step by Step
* Deep Neural Network - Application
* Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
* Planar data classification with one hidden layer


Next Lesson was on hyperparameter tuning and batch normalization. 
solved excercises on
* Gradient Checking
* Initialization
* Optimization method
* Regularization 
* Tensor Flow

TensorFlow learning process is deliberate, steady and unrushed, and following these tutorials as well as other literature sources

* Tensor tutorial (edureka)
* Intro to Tensorflow (udacity)(currently going on)



convolution neural networks by Andrew ng(currently goin on)
* LeNet-5 implementatoin
* ResNet implementation
